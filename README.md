# Santa App

Getting started with create-react-app, during christmas break I made simple app where you can:
-Add new childs to Santa's list;
-Assign gifts to them;
-Remove gifts from stock;
-Inspect single gift element;


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
