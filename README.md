Getting started with create-react-app, during christmas break I made simple app where you can:
* Add new childs to Santa's list;
* Assign gifts to childs;
* Remove gifts from stock;
* Inspect single gift element;

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
